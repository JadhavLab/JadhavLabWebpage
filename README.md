# JadhavLabWebpage

This repository contains the W.I.P. code for the Jadhav Lab's webpage. SJ_3 is the current online version. SJ_4 comprises two possible templates we're exploring. Both pages are more or less complete.

Future updates will elaborate the news page, and make it either more tabular or blog-like in format. Future updates will also include jQuery code that will hopefully add some professional panache and wow-factor.
