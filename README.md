# JadhavLabWebpage

This repository contains work-in-progress code for the Jadhav Lab's website. Code currently covers two possible templates, one of which we've chosen for our current webpage.

Future updates will elaborate the news page structure, and make it either more tabular or blog-like in format. Future updates should also include jQuery code that will hopefully add some glitzy panache.
